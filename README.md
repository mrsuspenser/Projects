# Projects
A place for all my little projects to live

I am currently in school for an AS in Computer Programming and Analysis, and while many of my actual programming classes don't start until next year I wanted to have a place for all my little projects to go.  As of writing this mainly the only code in here will be written in Python, as that is the only language that I have any familiarity with.  However, there will likely be projects written in C, C#, Java Script, and maybe COBOL.

Obviously everybody starts somewhere, and I am just beginning so please be kind if you have any constructive criticism, which I am open to.
